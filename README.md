# Co-Extracting-Opinion-Targets-and-Opinion-Words-From-Online-Reviews

In today’s e-commerce world or in competitive market structure, lots of
analyzed data is required for betterment of services, probability calculations,
predictions, business decisions and summary of market reputation etc. This analysis is
obtained through the detail summary of customer feedback and product reviews etc. To
analyze this kind of data, opinion mining techniques are used. Hence for fine grained
output from opinion mining, word alignment model and patterns of sentences are
discussed in this project.
Our method based on a monolingual word alignment model (WAM). An
opinion target can find its corresponding modifier through word alignment.“colorful”

and “big” are aligned with the target word “screen”. Compared to previous nearest-
neighbor rules, the WAM does not constrain identifying modified relations to a limited

window; therefore, it can capture more complex relations, such as long-span modified
relations. Compared to syntactic patterns, the WAM is more robust because it does not
need to parse informal texts. In addition, the WAM can integrate several intuitive
factors, such as word co-occurrence frequencies and word positions,into a unified
model for indicating the opinion relations among words. Thus, we expect to obtain
more precise results on opinion relation identification.
